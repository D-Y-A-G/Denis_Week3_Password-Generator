# Denis_Week3_Password-Generator
Creating a Password Generator with JavaScipt

This homework was a challenge. The goal was to generate a randomized password that included criteria that was defined by user utilizing prompt commands.
I really got a undestanding of the importance of pseudo coding as well as learning to think as a developer to be able to work on parts of the project instead
thinking of the final result. 

Attached is an image of the page before generating randomized password and another with password generated.
